proxy.{c,h}	- Primary proxy code
csapp.{c,h}	- Wrapper and helper functions from the CS:APP text

The entirety of the proxy program is written in the main function
of proxy.c. The program first creates a socket and binds it
to the requested port, then passively listens for connections,
and finally enters the main loop for accepting connections from
the client browser. Once a connection is established with the client,
the proxy reads the request from the client, rewrites the HTTP
request, writes the response back while there is still response
remaining, and finally logs this entry into logfile.txt. The
program can be run by first running `make clean`, `make`, then finally
`./proxy portNumber`.
