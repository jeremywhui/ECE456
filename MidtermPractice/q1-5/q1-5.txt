Question 1
What is the key difference between Standard I/O and System Call I/O?
Standard I/O is buffered and therefore minimizes the number of system
calls to read and write, whereas the system call I/O is unbuffered 
and therefore must invoke the kernel each time it makes a read or write.

Which one generally provides better performance, and why?
Generally standard I/O provides better performance, because it less
system calls to read and write and can instead read and write to/from
the buffer. This makes it so that it does less context switching to
be in system mode from user mode, and therefore results in higher
performance (less time to read and write).

When would it be better to use system calls instead of Standard I/O?
It would be better to use system calls instead of Standard I/O if
you have a memory sensitive application and cannot afford to use
extra memory to maintain a buffer. Additionally if you do not want
to use a buffer, like printing to stderr, it may be better to use system
calls.

Question 2
IPv4 uses 32-bit format, while IPv6 uses 128-bit format
It is represented as 4 decimal numbers, while IPv6 uses
8 hexadecimal numbers separated by colons.
